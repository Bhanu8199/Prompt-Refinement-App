🔹 Project Build Prompt: Multi-Modal Prompt Refinement System

You are an experienced AI systems architect and software engineer.
Design and implement a Multi-Modal Prompt Refinement System that converts unstructured, multi-format user inputs into a clean, validated, and standardized prompt schema suitable for downstream AI workflows.

🧠 Core Objective

Build a system that accepts heterogeneous inputs (text, images, documents, or combinations) and intelligently refines them into a single, consistent, structured prompt representation, while explicitly handling ambiguity, missing information, and irrelevant inputs.

The system should prioritize clarity, traceability, and decision justification, not just raw extraction.

🔹 Supported Input Modalities

The system must accept any of the following:

Plain text (product ideas, instructions, descriptions)

Images (UI wireframes, product sketches, screenshots)

Documents (PDF / Word files containing specifications)

Hybrid inputs (any combination of text, image, and document)

Each input type must be processed through a dedicated extraction strategy, then unified into a shared semantic representation.

🔹 Prompt Refinement Responsibilities

From the provided inputs, extract and infer the following:

Primary Intent
What problem is the user trying to solve?

Functional Expectations
What capabilities or behaviors are explicitly or implicitly requested?

Technical or Operational Constraints
Platforms, technologies, performance limits, compliance needs (only if mentioned or strongly implied)

Expected Outputs
What should the final system or AI generate or deliver?

Confidence & Ambiguity Indicators
Explicitly flag missing, conflicting, or weakly inferred information

🔹 Structured Output Design (Your Own Template)

Design a custom prompt schema that:

Separates explicit facts vs inferred assumptions

Marks required vs optional fields

Includes a missing-information section

Includes a refinement confidence score

Supports validation and rejection logic

You must justify every field in the schema with reasoning.

🔹 System Behavior Rules

If input is incomplete → refine what is possible and clearly list missing fields

If input is ambiguous → provide best inference + ambiguity warning

If input is irrelevant or non-actionable → reject with explanation

Ensure consistent output structure regardless of input type

🔹 Technical Expectations

Modular extraction pipeline per modality

Unified intermediate representation before refinement

Validation layer to enforce schema consistency

Clear error handling and rejection messaging

Simple but explainable logic over black-box complexity

🔹 Deliverables

Working prototype (CLI or Streamlit preferred)

Source code with inline documentation

Formal prompt schema documentation

At least 5 diverse sample inputs with refined outputs

Detailed explanation document covering:

Thought process and problem breakdown

Design rationale for schema and architecture

Prioritization logic

Alternatives considered and rejected

Clear separation of AI-assisted vs original work

🔹 Critical Instruction

Do not blindly rely on AI-generated logic.
All architectural decisions, schema design, validation rules, and prioritization logic must be explicitly reasoned and documented as original analytical work.

Focus on system design clarity, explainability, and robustness, not overengineering.

🎯 Expected Outcome

A thoughtfully designed, well-documented system that demonstrates:

Strong engineering judgment

Structured problem-solving

Real-world AI pipeline thinking

Ownership of decisions
